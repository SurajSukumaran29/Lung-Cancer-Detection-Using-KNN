The Lung Cancer Detection project using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) aims to identify potential lung cancer cases by analyzing patient data, such as imaging features or clinical metrics. KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm that classifies cases based on the similarity to nearby instances, allowing it to recognize patterns linked to cancer. This model helps detect lung cancer at an early stage, supporting doctors in diagnosis and potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.
For lung cancer detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the data typically includes:

    Age: The patient's age, as cancer risk increases with age.
    Gender: Male or female, which may influence risk factors.
    Smoking Habits: Number of cigarettes smoked per day, as smoking is a primary risk factor.
    Environmental Exposure: Exposure to harmful substances like radon, asbestos, or air pollution.
    Family History: Information about whether the patient has relatives who had lung cancer.
    Medical History: Previous lung diseases or conditions that could increase cancer risk.
